Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away 

So I'll start a revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside. Summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out 

So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say 

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock n Roll band
Who'll throw it all away

Gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out 

So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as she's walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say 

So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say

So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger
I heard you say
At least not today
